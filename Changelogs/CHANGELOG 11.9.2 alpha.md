# SysPulse Changelog

## Version 11.9.2 Alpha - Bug Fixes Release
*Release Date: July 19, 2025*

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Process Filter Modal Improvements
- **Fixed widget navigation interference** - Widget navigation keys (C, M, D, N, P, G) no longer interfere when typing in search input fields (filtering processes)
- **Fixed Tab navigation in modals** - Tab key now properly navigates between form fields in process filter modal instead of triggering global widget cycling
- **Fixed filter state persistence** - Process filter modal now correctly remembers and displays the previously selected filter type and search term when reopened
- **Improved input field focus detection** - Enhanced logic to detect when user is typing in input fields to prevent unwanted global shortcut activation

#### Visual Consistency Improvements
- **Enhanced memory bar styling** - Memory bars now use consistent styling with colored usage portion and white empty portion using `‚ñë` character for better visual consistency
- **Simplified memory widget design** - Removed unnecessary color complexity from memory bars in favor of simple two-color design matching disk widget style
- **Updated disk bar display** - Disk bars now show next to the used/total GB information for better space utilization and visual consistency

#### Input Handling Enhancements
- **Smart input field detection** - Global input handler now properly detects when focus is on `tview.InputField` or `tview.Form` elements
- **Conditional shortcut processing** - Widget navigation shortcuts are now only processed when not actively typing in input fields
- **Preserved form functionality** - Tab navigation within forms works correctly while maintaining global Tab cycling for main interface
- **Eliminated redundant nil checks** - Removed unnecessary nil checks in type assertion patterns where the assertion itself provides nil safety

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Input Capture Logic Enhancement
```go
// Enhanced input handler with smart field detection
currentFocused := d.App.GetFocus()
_, isInputField := currentFocused.(*tview.InputField)
_, isForm := currentFocused.(*tview.Form)

// Allow normal keyboard input when in an input field
shouldProcessGlobalKeys := isMainWidgetActive && !isInputField && !isForm
```

#### Modal State Management
- **Filter state preservation** - Process filter term and type are now properly stored and restored
- **Dropdown index calculation** - Correct mapping between filter types and dropdown indices
- **Search input restoration** - Previous search terms are populated when reopening filter modal
- **Event timing optimization** - SetChangedFunc now called after form setup to prevent interference

#### Widget Visual Improvements
- **Memory bar simplification** - Updated `getMemoryBar()` function to use simplified color scheme
- **Consistent progress bar styling** - Memory and disk widgets now share unified visual design language
- **Improved bar positioning** - Disk bars repositioned to appear inline with usage statistics

### üìã Affected Components

#### Modal System
- `internal/services/UI/modals.go` - Enhanced process search modal with state persistence and improved input handling
- `internal/services/UI/layout.go` - Improved global input handling logic with smart field detection

#### Widget Systems
- `internal/services/memory/vmem.go` - Updated memory bar styling for consistency
- `internal/services/disk/usage&partitions.go` - Enhanced disk bar positioning and display
- `internal/utils/models.go` - Simplified memory model structure

### üéØ User Experience Improvements

#### Filter Modal Usability
- **Intuitive typing experience** - Users can now type normally in search fields without unexpected widget switching
- **Persistent filter state** - No need to re-enter search terms or re-select filter types when reopening modal
- **Proper form navigation** - Tab key works as expected within forms for field-to-field navigation
- **Seamless modal interaction** - Input events are properly routed to prevent conflicts

#### Visual Enhancement
- **Unified progress bar styling** - Memory and disk widgets now share consistent visual design language
- **Clean color scheme** - Simplified color usage in progress bars for better readability
- **Professional appearance** - Consistent styling across all measurement widgets
- **Better space utilization** - Optimized layout for better information density

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Context-aware shortcuts** - Global shortcuts only activate when appropriate, preserving typing experience
- **Consistent behavior** - Tab navigation works predictably in both main interface and modal contexts
- **Reduced user frustration** - Eliminated unexpected widget switching while typing

### üîÑ Migration Notes

#### Automatic Updates
- **No configuration changes required** - All improvements are automatically applied
- **Backward compatibility maintained** - Existing themes and configurations continue to work
- **No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved

#### Behavior Changes
- **Improved modal interaction** - Users will notice smoother typing experience in search fields
- **Enhanced form navigation** - Tab key behavior is now consistent with standard form conventions
- **Better state persistence** - Filter settings are remembered between modal opens
- **Consistent widget styling** - Memory and disk widgets now have unified appearance

### üß™ Testing Recommendations

#### Filter Modal Testing
1. **Open process filter modal** (Press 'P' then 'F')
2. **Type search terms** - Verify letters like 'c', 'm', 'd' don't trigger widget navigation
3. **Use Tab key** - Confirm it navigates between form fields
4. **Apply filter and reopen** - Verify search term and filter type are restored
5. **Test global shortcuts** - Confirm they work normally in main interface

#### Widget Visual Testing
1. **Check memory bar styling** - Verify bars show colored usage with white empty portion
2. **Compare with disk bars** - Confirm consistent visual styling
3. **Test different usage levels** - Verify bars display correctly across usage ranges
4. **Check bar positioning** - Verify disk bars appear correctly next to usage statistics

### üîß Developer Notes

#### Input Event Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí Global Handler ‚Üí Field Detection ‚Üí Route to Appropriate Handler
                          ‚Üì
                   [Main Widget] ‚Üí Process Global Shortcuts
                   [Form/Input] ‚Üí Pass Through for Normal Typing
```

#### State Management Pattern
```go
// Filter state persistence pattern
if d.ProcessFilterActive {
    searchInput.SetText(d.ProcessFilterTerm)
    filterState.filterType = d.ProcessFilterType
}
```

#### Type Assertion Best Practice
```go
// Simplified type assertion without redundant nil check
_, isInputField := currentFocused.(*tview.InputField)
// Type assertion provides nil safety automatically
```

#### Widget Styling Consistency
```go
// Unified memory bar implementation
usedBar := strings.Repeat(utils.BAR, usedWidth)
emptyBar := strings.Repeat("‚ñë", barWidth-usedWidth)
return fmt.Sprintf("[%s]%s[-][%s]%s[-]", barColor, usedBar, 
    utils.GetColorFromName(d.Theme.Foreground), emptyBar)
```
